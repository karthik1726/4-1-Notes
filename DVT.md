# Short Answer Questions:

1.  What are the seven stages of the data visualization process?  
- **Seven Stages of Data Visualization Process**: 
   The stages are:
   - **Acquire** (gathering data),
   - **Parse** (structuring and organizing data),
   - **Filter** (removing irrelevant or noisy data),
   - **Mine** (applying data analysis methods),
   - **Represent** (choosing a visual model),
   - **Refine** (polishing visuals for clarity), and 
   - **Interact** (adding user interaction for better exploration).

2.  What are the main differences between sketching and scripting in Processing?

- **Differences between Sketching and Scripting in Processing**:
   Sketching in Processing is more about creating quick, informal drafts or ideas, often using hand-drawn visuals. Scripting, on the other hand, refers to coding or using algorithms to generate visualizations. Sketching allows creativity without technical constraints, while scripting offers precision, interactivity, and scalability.

3. Illustrates the key considerations when choosing a dataset for visualization?
- **Key Considerations When Choosing a Dataset for Visualization**:
   Key considerations include data relevance to the goal, data accuracy and reliability, completeness (handling missing values), structure (clean and well-organized), and size (manageable for the intended visualization). The dataset should also align with the message or insights you want to convey.

4. What are the advantages and limitations of using different methods to connect points in a 
visualization?
- **Advantages and Limitations of Connecting Points in Visualizations**:
   Line or curve connections between points in visualizations, like time-series graphs, provide a clear trend representation, but can imply continuity where none exists. On the other hand, scatter plots maintain the individuality of points but might obscure trends if the dataset is large.

5. How do we handle missing or incomplete data during pre-processing?
- **Handling Missing Data During Pre-Processing**:
   Techniques like removing rows or columns with missing data, imputing values using mean, median, or mode, or applying machine learning techniques (e.g., k-nearest neighbors) help address missing data. The chosen method depends on the extent of missing data and its impact on analysis.
6. What are the seven stages of the data visualization process?
- **Seven Stages of Data Visualization Process**: 
   Reiterating the stages:
   Acquire, Parse, Filter, Mine, Represent, Refine, Interact. These guide the journey from data collection to user interaction.
7. What factors should be considered when selecting data sources and tools during planning?
- **Factors to Consider When Selecting Data Sources and Tools**:
   Consider data reliability, accessibility, format compatibility, the complexity of the data, and the specific visualization goals. Tools should be selected based on their scalability, ease of use, compatibility with the dataset, and ability to produce interactive, effective visualizations.
8. What are the main types of data that can be visualized?
- **Types of Data That Can Be Visualized**:
   The main types include quantitative (numerical values), categorical (distinct groups), ordinal (ordered categories), temporal (time-based data), and spatial (geographical data).
9. What are the different methods for connecting data points in visualizations? 
- Methods for Connecting Data Points in Visualizations**:
   Common methods include straight lines, curves (e.g., BÃ©zier curves), and step-wise connections. The choice depends on the nature of the data, e.g., linear connections for continuous data or step-wise for categorical shifts.

10. What methods can be used to normalize or scale the data for consistency?
- **Methods for Normalizing or Scaling Data**:
    Techniques include min-max normalization, z-score standardization, and logarithmic scaling. These methods ensure data consistency, especially when combining datasets with different ranges, helping prevent biases in analysis and visualization.
